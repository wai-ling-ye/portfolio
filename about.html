      <p><span class="intro_sentence">Design is at its best when we can use design to bridge a gap in the user’s ability to accomplish their goals.</span> On the individual level, I use design to help people work smarter, and do better for themselves and others by making everything from day to day tasks to complex processes more intuitive and accessible. On a high level, designs I create can lead to widespread adaptation of new technology and change the way people interact.</p>

      <h4>What introduced you to design?</h4>
      <p>I discovered my interest in design as a gradual process starting with my introduction to photoshop at a young age. I taught myself how to use Photoshop, and at the time I used photoshop to create photo manipulation art. A few years later, I took a digital media class, which expanded my media toolkit to Illustrator and Flash, among other programs. When I entered the University of Rochester, I was majoring in biology, but I always gravitated back to digital media. During my four years, I was always on the executive board of various clubs as the publicity manager. My work with digital media transformed from art to advertising, and I discovered the exhilarating feeling of making art that does work. I loved the feeling of creating posters and ads that not only conveyed a message, but spoke to the emotions and desires of my audience.<br>When I found out about the field of UX Design, I felt like a fire was lit inside of me. This was a field that focused on function first, and whose goal was to create beautiful things that work beautifully.</p>
      <h4>Why is design important to you?</h4>
      <p>Design is like body language. Most of the time, you don’t notice it, but it is a constant and essential aspect of the interaction between a user and a product. Design has in the past created sweeping societal revolutions, most notably with the advent of personal computers, by facilitating communication between a creator and a user. Great design makes complicated ideas and technologies accessible to the wider public, which on the large scale moves us forward as a society, and on the small scale, makes our everyday interactions faster, easier, and more enjoyable.</p>
