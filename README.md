# The Design Portfolio of Wai Ling Ye

[View the website at wyedesign.me](wyedesign.me)

I am a user experience designer looking for an internship or junior UX position in New York City. I am currently completing a user experience design apprenticeship at Bloc, but before that I was a financial representative at National Life Group and studied for a degree in Cell and Developmental Biology. I love that I can combine both my experience with collaborating and strategizing directly with consumers and my background in research in creating designs for websites and apps. I want to use my skills in design to make technology and information accessible to people from all walks of life.
