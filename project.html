      <h3>Objective</h3>
      <p>Cloud storage can do more than keep your files safe. Remkeep makes it easy to save and organize files and web content in one place using a visual organization system. The ease and flexibility of Remkeep allows your cloud storage to become your go-to dashboard for work and play.</p>

      <h4>The Problem</h4>
      <p>Despite the existence of popular, big-name cloud storage services, there are two major problems:</p>
        <ul class="bulleted_list">
          <li>Existing cloud storage services allow you to exclusively upload files from your computer (ex. Dropbox) or save links from the web (ex. Pinterest).</li>
          <li>Cloud storage tends to be messy and cluttered.</li>
        </ul>
      <p>Remkeep strives to solve both these problems by allowing you to save any kind of content in a clean, visually organized space. </p>
    </article>

    <article class="grey_bg">
      <h4>The Solution</h4>
      <p>The cloud storage options that exist today act as a simple repository. You put your files into a safe deposit box, and you can view or  take those files out of the box later.</p>
      <p>But this is not enough.</p>
      <p>I want our users to not only have a portable repository, but to use cloud storage service as the central hub for all digital activities. If your personal devices are used to create your own ideas, and the web is where you find ideas and inspiration from others, then our cloud will be the place to bring it all together in a clean, clear, organized space.</p>

      <h4>User Stories</h4>
      <p>User stories are the first step in the information architecture phase. I use user stories to enter into the mind of user in order to prioritize tasks that the user will want to accomplish. These priorities will guide us on which content to include in the minimum viable product.</p>
      <a href="" class="button">View the User Stories</a>
      <h4>User Flows</h4>
      <p>The user stories inform our user flows. User flows illustrate step by step process by which the user will take to accomplish each task. These flows reflect the sequence of pages and options that will be available on the website.</p>

      <h4>Wireframes</h4>
      <p>Wireframes provide a simple,  visual outline of the layout and navigation of the website. I touch on visual design here, but the main focus is making sure that we deliver information to the user in a clear and intuitive fashion.<br>As this is the first visual that we will have of the website, I start with sketches, which allows me to generate a large number of layouts from which I can select the ideal layouts for the intended content.<br>I then selected the layouts which I believed to work best with the content strategy, and created clean wireframes in Balsamiq. I used my user stories and user flows to prioritize which pages to create and what information to include on each page.</p>

    <article>
      <h4>User Testing - Round One</h4>
      <p>In this first round of user testing, I am primarily testing: 1. the clarity of the information architecture and  2. the ease of navigation. To do this, I ask users to perform a series of tasks, which bring them through the various pages of the site. By observing how users navigate the website, I can identify areas that they navigate easily, and areas where they struggle to understand information or navigation.</p>
      <a href="" class="button">View the User Testing Script</a>
      <p>I tested with 3 users, each of whom provided me with 12-15 issues to be considered for further improvement. I identified the top 3 issues for each user to prioritize for improvement, which included:</p>
      <table>
        <tr><td>
          <h5>Problem</h5>
          <p>No prices on the upgrade page</p>
        </td></tr>
        <tr><td>
          <h5>Solution</h5>
          <p>Add prices to the upgrade page</p>
        </td></tr>
      </table>

      <table>
        <tr><td>
          <h5>Problem</h5>
          <p>Landing page is not informative enough about the app</p>
        </td></tr>
        <tr><td>
          <h5>Solution</h5>
          <p>Have more information or images or videos to explain the features of the app</p>
        </td></tr>
      </table>

      <table>
        <tr><td>
          <h5>Problem</h5>
          <p>Initially unsure of what the upload icon represented</p>

        <tr><td>
          <h5>Solution</h5>
          <p>Improve the iconography of the upload button</p>
        </td></tr>
      </table>
      <p>Despite the issues encountered, all three users found the website to be intuitive and easy to navigate, and, for the most part, had no problem with performing the tasks. Because of this, I decided to move ahead with the next stage of the design process with the plan to implement the suggested improvements later in the high fidelity prototype.</p>

      <h3>High Fidelity Prototypes</h3>
      <p>Although the primary focus for the minimum viable product for our cloud storage service is a web browser based application, I decided to create the mobile mockup first to ensure scalability.<br>The desktop mockup of the dashboard was then created using a combination of the layout used in the wireframe and the visual style used in the mobile mockup. I also made a series of adjustments to elements of the dashboard page to solve issues encountered during the wireframe testing phase.</p>

      <h4>Preference Testing</h4>
      <p>Before I moved on to usability testing for the high fidelity prototypes, I turned to my users to help me make some design choices. Preference tests are a great tool to use to help me decide between two design choices about a specific element.</p>
      <div class="pt_overlay pt_overlay_img">
        <img src="images/remkeep/pt_overlay_img1.jpg" alt="">
        <div class="num_overlay">70%</div>

        <div class="num_overlay">30%</div>
      </div>
      <h4>Test One: Overlay Color</h4>
      <p>The blue toned background was preferred 70% of the time. Users who preferred this option cited that the blue tone actually provides better contrast between the darkened area and the brighter (interactable) areas. Users also found this choice to be more visually appealing.</p>
      <div class="pt_mobile">
        <div class="pt_mobile_img1">

      </div>
      <h4>Test Two: Mobile Dashboard</h4>
      <p>Out of 14 participants, there was an exactly 50/50 split between the two screens.  I decided to use the dashboard on the right because it’s more important for the user to understand the content at a glance. The dashboard on the left may have more visual appeal, but may cause greater frustration in usage.</p>

      <h3>User Testing</h3>
    </div>

    <article>
      <h4>User Testing - Round Two</h4>
      <p>In this stage of usability testing, I used the same general script outline and task list as I used for the first usability testing phase, but expanded the script to include the mobile prototype. Using the same format for the second usability testing phase will help us to compare the performance of the first prototype to the second prototype, and evaluate whether our solutions were effective. The goals of this usability testing phase are:</p>
      <ol class="numbered_list">
        <li>Determine whether I successfully solved issues identified in wireframe usability test.</li>
        <li>Identify areas where the testers struggle to understand or use the high fidelity mockup (ie. issues with usability).</li>
        <li>Receive feedback on the look and feel of the mockup (ie. issues with visual design).</li>
      </ol>
      <p>During this testing phase, I tested the desktop and mobile prototypes with three users, each of whom provided me with 25-35 issues to be considered for further improvement. I identified the top 3-4 issues encountered by each user to prioritize for improvement, which included:</p>
      <table>
        <tr><td>
          <h5>Problem</h5>
          <p>Confused that the “gallery” opened inside of the app - expected to open the native gallery app (mobile)</p>

        <tr><td>

      <div class="mobile_upload_img"><img src="images/remkeep/mobile_upload_img.jpg" alt="Changes to the mobile upload page"></div>
      <p>The mobile app had very few issues, but the issues with the upload process were very significant because it impacts one of the core functions of the cloud storage service: uploading to the cloud.<br>The last priority issue that I had to tackle was the visual hierarchy of the dashboard. One user specifically stated that the dashboard appeared to be confusing and visually cluttered, and the other two users took a few seconds to make sense of the page, which indicates to me that the dashboard is poorly organized and does not accomplish our original goal of creating a strong organizational system.</p>

      <div class="grey_bg"><p>In the updated version of the dashboard, the new layout is a single column with one folder per row with its contents displayed horizontally across the row. I then made other visual changes to reduce the clutter.<br>I then took the visual changes that I made on the dashboard, and recreated those changes across various pages and elements on the desktop mockup and mobile mockup in order to create a consistent visual experience.</p></div>

      <h4>Branding Update</h4>
      <p>After completing the visual changes, there was one last issue that I wanted to tackle. All three of the users were initially confused about what kind of service the website was offering. The source of the confusion was the name of the brand itself.  To address this issue, I changed the name of the brand to “Remkeep”, which gives more of an impression of storage, and helps dissociate the brand from the idea of sleeping.</p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>The completed prototypes accomplish our original objective of allowing users to seamlessly organize personal files and web content together in a visually oriented space. By solving issues encountered during several stages of user testing, I was able to create a website that was intuitive for users to understand and navigate.</p>

      <h3>What I Learned</h3>
      <p>Designing Remkeep helped me to see what the design process looks like, from the first seeds of conception to a polished visual design. I experienced the impact the initial ideation, planning and research had on every stage leading up to the final delivery. I also learned that users are our most valuable resource. Our users guided me through the entire creation of Remkeep, from the surveys to the usability tests, providing me with valuable information to create an attractive and intuitive product.</p>
